## Overview
This project explores the **intersection of medical imaging and computer vision**, focusing on **transforming volumetric MRI data into detailed 3D heart models** while preparing refined data for a **deep learning model** that predicts accurate segmentation masks. By applying advanced image processing techniques, correcting intensity distortions, and enhancing 3D mesh reconstructions, the system improves both **segmentation accuracy and diagnostic insights**.


## Project Goals
The primary goal is to **streamline the diagnostic process** by:  
- **Generating 3D heart models** through surface mesh reconstruction.  
- **Training a predictive deep learning model** to segment heart structures based on refined MRI data and patient conditions.  

## **What This Project Covers**
- **Preprocessing & Standardization:** Correcting intensity distortions and artifacts through metric-based analysis.  
- **3D Reconstruction & Refinement:** Using the **Ball-Pivoting Algorithm (BPA)** with **Gaussian smoothing** and thresholding to generate an anatomically accurate 3D heart mesh.  
- **Data & Metric Analysis:** Investigating correlations between **patient metadata** and MRI scan metrics to guide model learning.  
- **Segmentation Model Preparation:** Preparing clean, high-quality input data for a deep learning model that predicts segmentation masks based on patient conditions.
